This is a simple tile map game of size 800x800 displayed on
a 400x400 canvas with 1 main character,
20 prizes to collect, 50 rocks, and 6 enemies (with FSM mechanics). Each size of each object is 20 pixels. The main character (tank) must collect all 20 prizes (chests) to complete the game without getting touched by the enemies (ninjas). The rocks provide a bouncing mechanism where each the enemy and main character must move around the rocks. The main character can also use missiles shoot the enemies.

FSM (Finite State Machine) is a computational model used to describe the behavior of a system through a set of states, transitions, and actions. In game development, FSM can be used to implement game mechanics, character AI, and other interactive behaviors.
